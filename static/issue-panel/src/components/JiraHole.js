// 
// here's an example of how you might use React to create a component that represents each hole in a golf game, 
// where the length of the hole is determined by the progress of a corresponding Jira issue

import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

const Hole = ({ issueKey }) => {
    const [issue, setIssue] = useState({});

    useEffect(() => {
        // Fetch data from Jira using the API
        const fetchData = async () => {
            const res = await fetch(`https://your-jira-instance.com/rest/api/2/issue/${issueKey}`);
            const data = await res.json();
            setIssue(data);
        };
        fetchData();
    }, [issueKey]);

    return (
        <div>
            {/* Use the issue data to determine the length of the hole */}
            <div>Hole length: {calculateHoleLength(issue)} </div>
        </div>
    );
};

const calculateHoleLength = (issue) => {
    // calculate hole length based on the progress of the issue
    const createdAt = new Date(issue.fields.created);
    const now = new Date();
    const timeInProgress = now - createdAt;
    const holeLength = timeInProgress / (1000 * 60 * 60); // hours
    return holeLength;
}

export default Hole;

// In this example, the Hole component takes an issueKey prop and uses it to fetch the corresponding Jira issue data using the Jira API. We are using the useEffect and useState hooks in React to achieve this.

// The calculateHoleLength function uses the created field of the issue to calculate the length of the hole based on the time that the issue has been in progress. In this example, it calculates the time in hours from the time it was created till current time, which you can then use to determine the length of the hole in the game.

// You can customize the logic in calculateHoleLength function to match your specific use case.
// It is also good to notice that this example doesn't cover the case when an issue has been resolved
// can add additional checks to cover this scenario.
